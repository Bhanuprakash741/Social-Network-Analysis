# 🌐 Graph Neural Networks for Social-Network Analysis
GCN · GAT · HetGNN on real-world social graphs

> Can we predict user behaviour, detect communities, and find influential nodes by combining network structure **and** node features?

---

## ✨ Key Features
| Module | Highlights |
|--------|------------|
| **Data Loader** | Reads SNAP/JSON edge lists; supports heterogeneous graphs (users ↔ posts ↔ topics). |
| **GCN pipeline** | 2-layer Kipf-Welling GCN with ReLU & dropout; semi-supervised learning. |
| **GAT pipeline** | Multi-head attention to weigh neighbour importance dynamically. |
| **HetGNN pipeline** | Bi-LSTM + attention per node-type for multi-relational graphs. |
| **Evaluation suite** | Accuracy, macro-F1, NMI/ARI for communities; ROC-AUC for influence tasks. |
| **Reproducible experiments** | YAML configs, TensorBoard logs, CSV result exports. |

---

## 📦 Requirements
* Python ≥ 3.9  
* `pip install torch torch_geometric dgl networkx scikit-learn tensorboard pyyaml matplotlib`  
* CUDA GPU recommended for graphs > 100 k edges
